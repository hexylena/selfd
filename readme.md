statsd for yourself

sometimes you just want to monitor some of those small one-off statistics and do so in a low friction way (e.g. "how many times did I see the old style tram on this line" or "what level of headache am i currently experiencing" or "please track my stool consistency") that one usually has to make a google form, for. And then you have to make graphs and it's a whole thing and you just wish it was more automatic.

## The idea

Add keys like 'trams/4/old' and 'trams/4/new' and then you can just tap those entries to increment them when you want to record a data point. We'll provide some graphing somehow based on your keys.
